a jazz lesson game aimed at helping users practice chords, scales, and chord shapes across all keys in a fun and interactive manner. A twist on the type racing genre.


Currently a shell that can correctly convert midi information to the proper note and display them on screen. Has basic chords class with 7th chords in the key of C. Want to add seperate levels, different speed for chords to travel at, inversions, scale practise, ryhthm practice and so much more.
